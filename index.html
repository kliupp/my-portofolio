    <h1 class="aboutmepgh1 fade-in">About Me</h1>
    <p class="aboutmepgp1 fade-in">Hi, my name is Rei, and I am a 13-year-old front-end developer. I began coding when I was 11 years old, and since then, my passion for creating websites and web applications has only grown stronger. I love the process of bringing ideas to life through code and designing user-friendly interfaces. My skills are focused on front-end development, primarily in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m always eager to learn more and improve. I believe that coding is a powerful tool for creativity and problem-solving, and I’m excited to continue my journey in the world of web development.</p>
